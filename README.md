Activity 8 - Special Variables
================

It is assumed that you have read Chapters 14, 15, and 16 from R4DS and
completed the Preparation items.

In this activity, you will somewhat choose your own adventure to use the
various packages for handling special variables in R.

## ☑️ Task 1: The Workflow

![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** this repo and clone it to a
new [RStudio Project](https://rstudio.gvsu.edu/).

Remember that more detailed directions can be found in [Task 1 of
Activity
6](https://github.com/gvsu-sta518/activity06-pivoting#%EF%B8%8F-task-1-the-workflow).

<b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you have any questions, contact your
instructor or another group. We will complete this Activity during our
next class session

## ☑️ Task 2: Choose an RMarkdown File

There are two Rmd file options for this activity:
`activity08-special-variables.Rmd` or `activity08-strings.Rmd`. Both
files use the same dataset. The strings file provides more directions
focusing on dates and parsing strings, while the special variables has a
“exploratory” feeling to it. For the rest of this class period, you will
complete the RMarkdown document with your neighbor(s). Your instructor
will be circling and be available to help when needed.

Note that each person is working in their own repo. We are not worrying
about collaborating for the time being and instead will be working on
being more comfortable with the workflow for working between RStudio and
GitHub.

However, do not continue in this README document until you and your
neighbor(s) have completed your `.Rmd` files.

## ☑️ Task 3: Reflection

This is the end of the activities for preparing data. What do you feel
like you have a good grasp of? What could you use more practice with?

**Next**: Next week we will spend time working on your Project.
